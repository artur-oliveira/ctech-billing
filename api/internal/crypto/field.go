// Package crypto encrypts individual field values before they are stored.

// DynamoDB's own server-side encryption protects the disk. It does not protect
// the value from anything holding read access to the table — a support tool, a
// migration script, an export, a role that accumulated `dynamodb:Query` for some
// other reason. For a CPF that difference is the whole of the control: the
// record ARCHITECTURE.md § 9 promises is "encrypted at rest by the repository
// layer", and until this package existed that sentence was not true.
//
// Scope is deliberately narrow: one AEAD and values that are read back by id and
// never searched. Anything that needed to be *queried* by its encrypted value
// would need deterministic encryption, which leaks equality and is a different
// decision — billing has no such field, and this package should not grow one
// quietly.
//
// Several keys may be held at once, which is what makes rotation possible: the
// highest generation writes, every generation reads. See NewSealer.
